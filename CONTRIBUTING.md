## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing several packages:

- `packages/scan` - Core React Scan package
- `packages/vite-plugin-react-scan` - Vite plugin for React Scan
- `packages/extension` - VS Code extension

## Development Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan.git
   cd react-scan
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Build all packages**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. **Development Mode**
   ```bash
   # Run all packages in dev mode
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Commits

We use conventional commits to ensure consistent commit messages:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features

Example: `fix(scan): fix a typo`

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes using conventional commits
4. Push to your branch
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Ask for reviews (@pivanov, @RobPruzan are your friends in this journey)

### Development Workflow

1. **TypeScript**
   - All code must be written in TypeScript
   - Ensure strict type checking passes
   - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary

2. **Code Style**
   - We use Biome for formatting and linting
   - Run `pnpm format` to format code
   - Run `pnpm lint` to check for issues

3. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
   - Update README if needed

## Getting Help
- Check existing issues
- Create a new issue
